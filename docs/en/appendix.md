## Learning Paths

### If You're Interested in Theory

```
Step 1: Read "Thinking in Systems" to build systems thinking
Step 2: Take Complexity Explorer's introduction course
Step 3: Read "Complexity" and "Linked"
Step 4: Dive deep into a specific topic (networks, chaos, evolution...)
```

### If You Want Hands-On Practice

```
Step 1: Install NetLogo, run example models
Step 2: Modify existing models, observe changes
Step 3: Design your own simple models
Step 4: Use models to explore questions you're interested in
```

### If You Want to Apply to Work

```
Step 1: Identify complex systems in your work
