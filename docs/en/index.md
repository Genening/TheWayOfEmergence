## Core Insight

> **The complexity of the world arises from simplicity.**
>
> By identifying basic elements and their interaction rules at the appropriate level of analysis, and patiently observing the critical points where quantitative change becomes qualitative change, we can understand that those seemingly mysterious emergent properties are simply the natural results of emergence.
>
> This is a way of cognition that both respects and transcends reductionism.
