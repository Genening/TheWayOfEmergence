    title: A Thread Connecting Everything
    details: Physics → Chemistry → Biology → Society → Economics → Intelligence. Different disciplines share the same underlying logic. Emergence is the cognitive thread linking all knowledge.

  - icon: 🔬
    title: Theoretical Foundation
    details: Extract the "Elements-Relations-Emergence" framework from physics, build a three-layer cognitive model, and understand the essence of complexity.

  - icon: 🌍
    title: Cross-disciplinary Applications
    details: Apply the framework to physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, computer science, and urban planning — revealing the deep unity of human knowledge.

## Core Insight

> **The brilliance of human civilization springs from a single underlying mechanism.**
>
> Physics emerges upward into chemistry, chemistry into biology — each layer builds upon the one below, integrating into new orders of complexity. Society, economics, and intelligence follow the same logic.
>
> The Way of Emergence is a cognitive thread connecting all disciplines — helping you learn, master, enjoy, and create your own contribution to civilization.
