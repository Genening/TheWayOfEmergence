# Author's Preface: The Cognitive Thread of Human Civilization

## A Thread That Connects Everything

Throughout our education, we all study many disciplines — physics, chemistry, biology, history, economics, mathematics... But in most people's minds, these subjects remain isolated islands with no bridges between them.

I wrote this book to offer **a single thread that connects everything**.

That thread is **emergence**.

Once you truly understand emergence, you see an entirely new picture: physics, chemistry, and biology are actually **the same discipline unfolding at different levels**. Physics emerges upward into the characteristics of chemistry; chemistry emerges upward into the properties of biology — each layer builds upon the one below, integrating into new orders of complexity. And their underlying logic is shared.

Sociology, economics, computer science — they all follow the same logic.

Even art — those creations that resonate with the human soul — shares structural logic with emergence in the natural sciences.

**The brilliance of human civilization springs from a single underlying mechanism.**

## Why I Wrote This Book

I am an entrepreneur and a deep cross-disciplinary learner.

The Chinese education system exposed me to a vast range of subjects over more than a decade of study — from physics to biology, from mathematics to history. As an entrepreneur, I also gained firsthand understanding of economics, sociology, and the laws of market dynamics through real-world practice. This accumulation of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries gradually revealed a truth:

> **Disciplines that appear independent actually share the same underlying logic.**

The emergence principle of "More is Different" in physics perfectly explains why simple chemical bonds can construct complex molecules of life. The "self-organization" principles in biology apply equally to understanding how cities spontaneously develop vibrant neighborhoods. The logic of the "invisible hand" driving market equilibrium in economics is structurally identical to how neural networks produce intelligence from simple rules.

When I saw these connections, I realized: **What we lack is not knowledge, but a cognitive framework that links knowledge together.**

This book is my attempt to articulate that framework.

## What This Book Aims to Do

I hope *The Way of Emergence* can serve as a **cognitive thread of civilization** — a key that helps readers break down the barriers between disciplines and see the complete picture of human knowledge.

Specifically, I hope it helps you:

**Learn** — Using emergence as a thread, systematically understand the core logic of physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, computer science, and other disciplines. See the deep connections between them.

**Master** — Acquire a transferable thinking methodology. Once you understand the underlying mechanism of emergence, you can reason by analogy and analyze any complex system with the same approach — whether it's an ecosystem, a market, an organization, or an AI model.

**Enjoy** — Appreciate the brilliant beauty of human civilization. When you see the symmetry of physical laws, the elegance of chemical structures, the grace of biological systems, and the spontaneous emergence of social order, you will marvel: the complex beauty of this world springs from such simple rules.

**Create** — Use this understanding to create value. Understanding the logic of emergence enables you to better design products, organize teams, build systems, and solve problems. You are no longer a passive receiver of knowledge, but an active creator of civilization.

## Cognitive Preparation for the Age of Intelligence

We stand at a historic turning point.

Artificial intelligence — intelligence that emerges from simple computational rules — is transforming the world at an unprecedented pace. When intelligence is no longer a uniquely human trait, we will face changes unprecedented in human civilization.

In this era, **understanding emergence means understanding the nature of intelligence**.

When you understand how intelligence emerges from simple rules, you will neither fear AI nor blindly worship it. Instead, you will clearly recognize that both AI and human wisdom are products of emergence — they share a common underlying logic while each possessing unique emergent characteristics.

With this cognitive framework, you are far more likely to maintain independent thinking in the age of intelligence, truly exercising the unique charm of human thought — not merely surviving, but thriving.

## Who This Book Is For

This is not a beginner's textbook starting from zero.

**It is for those who already have a foundation of knowledge and yearn to see the bigger picture.** If you have at least a high school education and some exposure to multiple disciplines, you will find this book opens a window — suddenly connecting scattered fragments of knowledge into a coherent network.

You might be:
- A lifelong learner full of curiosity about the world
- A professional seeking to break through disciplinary boundaries
- An entrepreneur wanting to build a systematic cognitive framework
- A thinker concerned about humanity's future in the AI age
- An educator hoping to help the next generation learn more effectively

Whatever your background, if you have ever sensed that "different disciplines seem to share some kind of connection" — this book was written for you. It will help you transform that vague intuition into a clear cognitive system.

## Becoming Part of Civilization

Each person is an element in the vast emergent system of human civilization.

Our thinking, creating, and communicating form the relational network of civilizational evolution. And what emerges from this network — scientific discoveries, works of art, technological breakthroughs, institutional innovations — these are the brilliant achievements of human civilization.

I hope this book is itself a small emergence: integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, entrepreneurial experience, and reflections on the age of intelligence into a new cognitive perspective that helps more people build their own knowledge systems.

Let us together — learn, master, enjoy, create.

Become that irreplaceable emergence within human civilization.
